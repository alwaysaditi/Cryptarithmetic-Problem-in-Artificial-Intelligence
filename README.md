# Cryptarithmetic-Problem-in-Artificial-Intelligence


This is the python code for solving a particular instance of the Cryptarithmetic Problem in AI.

It uses  ***Intelligent backtracking***

The functions for identifying the variables have been created mostly where we need to guess the value and backtrack . For the rest of the variables whose values can be computed directly , they're computed within the function themselves

The particular instance of the cryptarithmetic problem that we've chosen is CROSS + ROADS = DANGER
